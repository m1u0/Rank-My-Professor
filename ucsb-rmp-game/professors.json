I don't understand how the school let him teach an 800-person lecture. I think he should consider a different profession than teaching and pursue something else, because what he's doing is not working. HE SUCKS.",

He tries to be funny with bad memes and Star Wars references (sometimes Transformers) but wastes time doing it. His homework makes the class seem easy, but then he destroys you with his tests. For the love of all that is good, don't take his class.",
